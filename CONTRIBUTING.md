Contributions are always welcome.

This is the preferred ranking of which contributions are read and handled first and with greatest happiness:

- fork this git repository, pick the "main" branch and send pull requests of code which is tested, compilable, clang-formatted to my .clang-format file
- same for the recent "dev..." branch
- next: code wich hits above criteria, except it is a bit off from my preferred .clang-format, but at least using the Allman- or East-Coast-Coding style
- next: code wich hits above criteria, except it is using any of the built-in clang-format styles
- next: code wich is smal and can get compiled on PlatformIO / ESP8266 and loaded to Wemos D1 or NodeMCU3
- next: any small example code which compiles with g++ under Linux or under MSYS2+MinGW and does show errors.

The other way is to file an issue on github. But as you surely understand, I can follow issues only with much more effort compared to pull requests. This needs time. Like almost all other Open Source developers, somebody has to pay my bills, and that guy has some priorities.

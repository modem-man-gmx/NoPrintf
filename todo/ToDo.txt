Plans:

Structure:
  // split src, inc, demo_src?

Code Improvements:
  // std::string NoPrintf::get() vs.
  // std::string NoPrintf::get_ref()
  // do we need the distinction between ref and copy? in C++14 we have RVO, in 17 it is mandatory ... depends on what we have at ESP/PlatformIO ...
  // -> most PlatformIO project still stuck at gnu++11 (c++11 with gnu extension, which are required for some Espresif parts)
  // -> the good news: gnu++11 does RVO.

  // On: put()
  // give an functor as argument, with kind of puts() as default?

  // On: static std::string& collect_int( unsigned int uVal, std::string& buffer, bool Minus = false )
  // a hopefully smaller and faster implementation compared with ltoa() and to_string()
  // #ifdef switchable implementation via ltoa() and to_string()
  // do benchmarks on size and speed basically and on ESP

  // On: NoPrintf& NoPrintf::arg( unsigned long int uVal )
  // need to introduce template and template specification soon


Structure:
  // integrate Either GoogleTest (gTest) or UnitTest++ instead of handcrafted main() Demo code
  // some crowds in github seem to prefer "http://www.throwtheswitch.org/unity"
  // I'll start with https://github.com/zhangzheheng12345/Lightest

Implement Methods:
  NoPrintf& trim();
  NoPrintf& cut(siz_t max);

Denied:

Done:
  // SEEN, that C++11 does support Delegating Constructors, made it
